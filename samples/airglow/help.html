<body>
<b>Spark</b> is a modern programming language and feature rich computing environment. <br>It uses MzScheme as its programming language and comes with a large collection of libraries. <br>Spark extends the Scheme standard so that it is more accessible and useful for programmers who are new to Lisp like languages.<br>
<p>
Spark runs on GNU/Linux and similar systems. A Windows port is in progress.<br>
<p>
Through it's extensive library Spark offers support for databases, networking, multi-threading, GUI, graphics (2D and 3D) and web programming. <br>It is flexible enough to let you choose the paradigm that best suits the problem at hand. There is a powerful macro facility and support for libraries written in systems languages like C and C++.<br>
<p>
Spark code can be interpreted or compiled. When compiled, it is significantly faster than most high-level languages.<br>
<p>
Spark is free. It means it comes free of charge and also gives you certain freedoms. What this means is described in the GPL, under which Spark is licensed.<br>
